In the open-source spirit of the web, you have every right to copy and paste a piece of code that you find. For snippets that are longer than a line or two, still take the initiative to comment out your source URL. This is an individual job, you can ask your colleagues questions, but it should be your logic and your scripts. The goal is to develop your autonomy. In case of plagiarism, I will have to apply the sanctions of the PIEA. If you are really stuck contact me.',
